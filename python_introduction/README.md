## 0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise
__Task Description__:

You are required to complete a Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers. The script should do the following:

 - Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2.
 - Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
 - Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.


## 1. Simple Interest Calculator

**Objective**: Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

**Task Description**:

Your task is to complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T), where:

 - ( I ) is the interest earned,
 - ( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
 - ( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
 - ( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.

## 2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
__Objective__: Use basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width.

__Task Description__:

For this task, you are to write a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

__Instructions__:

 - Create a file named rectangle_area.py.
 - Define two variables in this file:
	- length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.
	- width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.
 - For simplicity, let’s use length = 10 and width = 5.
 -  Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length × width) and store the result in a variable named area.
 - Print the calculated area in a format: The area of the rectangle is: [area].

## 3. Convert Hours to Seconds 
__Objective:__ Demonstrate understanding of variable assignments and arithmetic operations by converting a given number of hours into seconds.

__Task Description__:

For this task, write a Python script that converts a specific number of hours into seconds. This task reinforces the concept of arithmetic operations within a practical context.

__Instructions__:

 - Create a file named hours_to_seconds.py.
 - Define a variable named hours and assign it a value representing the number of hours you want to convert to seconds. Use hours = 2.
 - Calculate the number of seconds in the given hours. Remember, there are 3600 seconds in an hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, thus 60 x 60 = 3600).
 - Store the result of the conversion in a variable named seconds.
 - Print the result in the format: [hours] hour(s) is [seconds] seconds.
