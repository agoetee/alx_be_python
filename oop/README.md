 ## 0. Create a Simple Bank Account Class

 __Objective:__ Understand the fundamentals of OOP in Python by implementing a `BankAccount` class that encapsulates banking operations. Use command line arguments to interact with instances of this class.
__Task Description__:

You will create two Python scripts: `bank_account.py`, which contains the `BankAccount` class, and `main-0.py`, which interfaces with the class through command line arguments to perform banking operations.
`bank_account.py`:

- __Class Definition__:
    1 Define a class named `BankAccount`.
        Use the __init__ method to initialize an `account_balance` attribute. Optionally, accept an initial balance parameter, defaulting to zero.

    2 Encapsulation and Behaviors:
        - Implement `deposit(amount)`, `withdraw(amount)`, and `display_balance() `methods.
        - `deposit` should add the specified amount to `account_balance`.
        - `withdraw` should deduct the amount from `account_balance` if funds are sufficient, returning `True`; otherwise, return `False` and do not alter the balance.
        - `display_balance` should print the current balance in a user-friendly format.

`main-0.py` for Command Line Interaction:

This script utilizes `BankAccount` through command line arguments for banking operations.

```py
import sys
from bank_account import BankAccount

def main():
    account = BankAccount(100)  # Example starting balance
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python main.py <command>:<amount>")
        print("Commands: deposit, withdraw, display")
        sys.exit(1)

    command, *params = sys.argv[1].split(':')
    amount = float(params[0]) if params else None

    if command == "deposit" and amount is not None:
        account.deposit(amount)
        print(f"Deposited: ${amount}")
    elif command == "withdraw" and amount is not None:
        if account.withdraw(amount):
            print(f"Withdrew: ${amount}")
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
    elif command == "display":
        account.display_balance()
    else:
        print("Invalid command.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Sample Command Line Usage and Expected Outputs:

1. __Deposit:__

```shell
python main-0.py deposit:50
```

Expected Output: `Deposited: $50`

2. __Withdraw with Sufficient Funds:__

```sh
python main-0.py withdraw:20
```

Expected Output: `Withdrew: $20`

3. __Withdraw with Insufficient Funds:__

```sh
python main-0.py withdraw:150
```

Expected Output:` Insufficient funds.`

4. __Display Balance:__

```sh
python main-0.py display
```

Expected Output: `Current Balance: $[amount]`

__Implementation Notes for you__:

- Ensure your `BankAccount` class in `bank_account.py` correctly implements the specified functionalities and adheres to the principles of encapsulation.
- Use `main.py` to test your `BankAccount` class by performing various operations. Adjust the initial balance as needed for testing different scenarios.
- This task combines learning OOP concepts with practical command line interaction, enhancing your understanding of Python programming.


## 1. Robust Division Calculator with Command Line Arguments
__Objective__: Implement a division calculator that robustly handles errors like division by zero and non-numeric inputs using command line arguments.
__Task Description__:

Create two Python scripts: `robust_division_calculator.py`, which contains the division logic including error handling, and `main.py`, which interfaces with the user through the command line.
`robust_division_calculator.py`:

Define a function `safe_divide(numerator, denominator)` that performs division, handling potential errors:

- __Division by Zero__: Use a try-except block to catch `ZeroDivisionError`.
- __Non-numeric Input__: Attempt to convert arguments to floats. Use a try-except block to catch `ValueError` for non-numeric inputs.
- Return appropriate messages for errors or the result for successful division.

`main.py` for Command Line Interaction:

This script will import `safe_divide` from `robust_division_calculator.py` and use it to divide numbers provided as command line arguments.

```py
import sys
from robust_division_calculator import safe_divide

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python main.py <numerator> <denominator>")
        sys.exit(1)

    numerator = sys.argv[1]
    denominator = sys.argv[2]

    result = safe_divide(numerator, denominator)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    
```

__Expected Behavior:__

The script is executed from the command line with two additional arguments representing the numerator and denominator. Here are sample commands and the expected outputs:

1. __Normal Division:__

```sh
python main.py 10 5
```

Expected Output: `The result of the division is 2.0`

2. __Division by Zero:__

```sh
python main.py 10 0
```

Expected Output: `Error: Cannot divide by zero`.

3. __Invalid Input (Non-numeric)__:

```sh
python main.py ten 5
  ```

Expected Output: `Error: Please enter numeric values only`.

__Implementation Notes for you:__

- Focus on error handling within `safe_divide `in `robust_division_calculator.py`. Ensure you cover the scenarios detailed above.
- Test your function using `main.py` by passing different types of inputs via command line arguments. This method allows you to quickly assess how well your error handling works in various situations.
- This task helps you practice writing error-resistant code, a crucial skill in software development.

## 2. Writing Unit Tests for a Simple Calculator Class 

Objective: Learn the basics of unit testing in Python by writing tests for a provided SimpleCalculator class that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
Provided: simple_calculator.py

Youâ€™re given a SimpleCalculator class with basic arithmetic operations. Your task is to write unit tests to verify its correctness.

# simple_calculator.py

class SimpleCalculator:
    """A simple calculator class that supports basic arithmetic operations."""

    def add(self, a, b):
        """Return the addition of a and b."""
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        """Return the subtraction of b from a."""
        return a - b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        """Return the multiplication of a and b."""
        return a * b

    def divide(self, a, b):
        """Return the division of a by b. Returns None if b is zero."""
        if b == 0:
            return None
        return a / b

Task: Write Unit Tests in test_simple_calculator.py

Create a test_simple_calculator.py script to define and run unit tests for each method in the SimpleCalculator class. Your tests should cover various scenarios to ensure the class functions correctly.
Guidelines for Writing Tests:

    Import the Necessary Modules:
        Import the unittest module and the SimpleCalculator class from simple_calculator.py.

    Define a Test Class:
        Create a test class that inherits from unittest.TestCase.

    Write Test Methods:
        Write at least one test method for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) provided by the SimpleCalculator.
        Include tests for edge cases, such as dividing by zero.

    Use Assertions to Verify Results:
        Utilize self.assertEqual() to check for expected outcomes.
        For the divide method, ensure you test both normal operation and division by zero.

    Running Your Tests:
        Run your tests using the command line: python -m unittest test_simple_calculator.py.

Example Test Method Structure:

import unittest
from simple_calculator import SimpleCalculator

class TestSimpleCalculator(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        """Set up the SimpleCalculator instance before each test."""
        self.calc = SimpleCalculator()

    def test_addition(self):
        """Test the addition method."""
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.add(2, 3), 5)
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.add(-1, 1), 0)
        # Add more assertions to thoroughly test the add method.

# Remember to write additional test methods for subtract, multiply, and divide.

Note for you:

    Your goal is to think like a tester and identify as many relevant test cases as possible for each method.
    Pay special attention to potential edge cases, such as division by zero, which could lead to unexpected behaviors if not properly handled.
    Writing comprehensive tests not only helps ensure your code is working correctly but also improves your understanding of how the code operates under different conditions.
